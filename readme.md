# LeetCode in JavaScript

This is the solutions collection of my LeetCode submissions, most of them are programmed in JavaScript. All JavaScript codes are wrote in ECMAScript 6 standard, each solution file will contain a problem description in the beginning, and followed by some necessary explanation, some problems will provide more than one solution, please refer to the comments after the main solution for one specific problem.

**ATTENTION**: If you also use JavaScript as your coding language, you should pay attention to some JavaScript INTERNAL issues, such as bitwise operators, so as to let you not drop into some trouble which may be caused by JavaScript itself.
